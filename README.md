# Random Variate Generation Examples for Simulation Course
Summer 2021

## Summary of Project

This repository contains examples of how to generate various probability distributions using random numbers. Although we know that a lot of different packages exist to create these distributions, one of our goals was to gain a deeper understanding of these distributions so we decided to code up the underlying math ourselves.

This project was create for our masters level simulation course.
